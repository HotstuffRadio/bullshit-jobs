  <div id="first"> 
    <p>It took me 2 hours to figure out that i didnt have the px symbol in the first DIV after the height and width 
      and that was why the boxes were not boxing rather they were rectangularing
    Sometimes all you need is a brain that can scan quickly and mine is a bit bloody slow, 
    just don't ask me to do a speed typing test</p>

<div id="second">
  <p>But you know what? I could still do a better job of running Greece than Mitsotakis and his nazi buddies, they have all the call centers of every wealthy country here paying us the pitiful minimum greek wage to do work that they have to pay 2 or 3 times the amount for in their own countries.</p>

</div>
<div id="third">
  <p>I think it is what is very correctly called a bullshit job - theyâ€™re cults designed to eat your life; Multinationals hoard
    your minutes jealously like dragons hoard gold. They keep inventing these jobs because of this false idea that everyone has to be
    employed at some sort of drudgery! Why? well it's
    Darwinian theory of course</p>

  <!-- TODOs:
1. Create 3 Boxes using the div element.
2. Set their sizes to 200px heigh by 200px wide.
3. Set different background colors for each of the boxes (I used cadetblue, gold and indianred).
4. Add a paragraph <p> element into the first div and add the following words:
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Aliquam at sapien porttitor urna elementum lacinia. In
    id magna pulvinar, ultricies lorem id, vehicula elit. Aliquam eu luctus nisl, vitae pellentesque magna. Phasellus
    dolor metus, laoreet ac convallis sit amet, efficitur sed dolor.
5. Set the 1st div to have 20px padding all around with a black 10px border.
6. Fix the style of the <p> element to remove all margins.
Hint: Use the CSS inspector in Chrome.
7. Set the 2nd div to have a 20px border on top and bottom and 10px border left and right. (See goal image)
8. Set the 3rd div to have a 10px border 
9. Set the margins for the divs so that each box corner touches the other. (See the goal image)
