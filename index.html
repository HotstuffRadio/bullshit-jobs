  <div id="first"> 
    <p>It took me 2 hours to figure out that i didnt have the px symbol in the first DIV of the CSS code, after the height 
      and width which was why the boxes were not boxing rather they were rectangularing.
    Sometimes all you need is a brain that can scan quickly and mine is bloody slow, 
    just don't ask me to do a speed typing test</p>

</div> 
<div id="second">
  <p>But you know what? fvck Mitsotakis and his nazi men asshole buddies, 
    they have all the call centers of every wealthy country here paying us the pitiful minimum greek wage 
    to do work that they have to pay 2 or 3 times the amount for in their minted countries, sweatshop labour ideologie$.</p>

</div>
<div id="third">
  <p>and there are so many bullshit jobs -omg - theyâ€™re like cults designed to eat peoples lives; Multinationals hoard
    labour like it's gold. They think we will not know its a sweatshop job if they call it something else, well guess what assholes, it's all sweatshop! Stupid ass ugly knuckle dragging patriarchal heteronormativity!</p>

  <!-- TODOs:
1. Create 3 Boxes using the div element.
2. Set their sizes to 200px heigh by 200px wide.
3. Set different background colors for each of the boxes (I used cadetblue, gold and indianred).
4. Add a paragraph <p> element into the first div and add the following words:
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Aliquam at sapien porttitor urna elementum lacinia. In
    id magna pulvinar, ultricies lorem id, vehicula elit. Aliquam eu luctus nisl, vitae pellentesque magna. Phasellus
    dolor metus, laoreet ac convallis sit amet, efficitur sed dolor.
5. Set the 1st div to have 20px padding all around with a black 10px border.
6. Fix the style of the <p> element to remove all margins.
Hint: Use the CSS inspector in Chrome.
7. Set the 2nd div to have a 20px border on top and bottom and 10px border left and right. (See goal image)
8. Set the 3rd div to have a 10px border 
9. Set the margins for the divs so that each box corner touches the other. (See the goal image)
